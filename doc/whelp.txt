OVERVIEW                                     *whelp-overview*

You know how some people highlight words they've looked up in the dictionary?
I'm not one of those people. But on a whim, I did write this little plugin to
keep track of things you've looked up in vim's help. Every time you run
`:h something` or `:help something`, vim-whelp records it in a text file. You can
then later open that file and browse around and even reopen the help entry.

REQUIREMENTS                                 *whelp-requirements*

Vim 7.4 or later. Some functions use `strftime` which is not included in every
vim distribution, but if you don't have it, vim won't break. Those functions
will just do less.

INSTALLATION                                 *whelp-installation*

     to their respective directories in your vimfiles, or copy the text from

     run `:helptags`.

USAGE                                        *whelp-usage*

Just keep using `:h` the way you always have. Vim-whelp will record your help
queries so you can peruse them later. By default, entries are written to
`$HOME/.vim/whelp.txt`. When whelp is opened in a split, the buffer will
autoclose when you leave it.
